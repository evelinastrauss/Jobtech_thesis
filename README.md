# Master thesis: Automatically extract metadata from job advertisements

This master thesis aims to investigate what methods and techniqyes can be used to automatically extract metadata from unstructured job advertisements to create value for the Swedish labor market. The focus will lie within supervised learn-
ing as binary classification will be performed on each job advertisement to extract
metadata. By investigating useful methods and techniques for this task, the Public
Swedish Employment Service can apply such techniques to automatically extract
metadata, and thereby display and offer more job advertisements in a structured
format on their website Platsbanken. It enables filtering, and searching for job ads, and contributes to a larger collection of ads in a shared platform, which facilitates the process of applying for jobs.

Based on requirements from the Swedish labor market, the following metadata will be extracted:
- Whether a job requires education or not
- Whether a job requires previous experience or not
- Whether a job requires a driving license or not
- Whether a job is full-time or part-time

This repository will contain code for the baseline, SVM and BERT classifiers.
